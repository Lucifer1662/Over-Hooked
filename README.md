## Explanation of the game
This game is a 3rd-person top-down fishing game with a few different levels. The aim of the game is to catch a certain amount of fish within the time limit, and progress through the levels.

### How to use it (especially the user interface aspects)
This game is intended to be played with a keyboard and mouse. Once the main menu appears, click start to play. You can also view the instructions of the game or quit the application.

  <img src="Gifs/Main Menu.png"  width="400" >
</p>

Then, select which level you would like to play. At the start, only one level will be avaliable to select. The other levels become unlocked as you progress through the game.

<p align="center">
  <img src="Gifs/Level Selection.gif"  width="400" >
</p>

When you are in the level, it is time to start catching some fish. Keep an eye on the timer, because if not enough fish are caught by the time the clock reaches zero then you fail the level. The amount of fish that need to be caught can be seen in the top left of the screen (the number on the right), as well as the number of fish you have currently caught (the number on the left).

</p>

In order to catch fish you may want to move the player to get a better look at the water. Use the WASD keys to move and point with the mouse the direction you want to look at. If you are looking in the direction of a fish, then left click, hold, and release to cast the fishing rod. The longer you hold down left click the further out the line will be cast. Once the fish bites (when you hear the sound effect) then click again to pull the fish back in.

If you catch the required number of fish before the timer ends, the level completion menu will pop up. Click the 'next' button to go to the next level, or 'retry' if you want to try and beat your record.

### How objects and entities were modelled
Overall, our vision for the aesthetic of the game was a simple cartoony style. We decided to stick to a low poly style as best as we could, since it has the potential to look really good and it is not as taxing on the computer (due to smaller vertex counts). Furthermore, if certain assets we wanted were not avaliable online then modelling our own (with unfortunately limited artistic skills) was an option because of the simplicity of the style. 

The following objects were modelled (by Jess) from scratch in Blender: The fish, the player, the fishing rod, and the island shape.

<p align="center">
  <img src="Gifs/Island.png"  width="300" >
</p>

The modelling process for these objects began with creating primitive meshes in blender such as cylinders, planes and spheres. They were then sculpted into the desired shape using Blender's intuitive sculpting tools. The final trick to making the models low-poly was to apply the 'Decimate' modifier. This removes some amount of verticies and condenses the mesh into simpler shapes. The models were then exported out of blender as a .fbx and imported into Unity. Since .fbx files contain material data as well, the colours of the models could then be adjusted in Unity as desired by modifying the material colour for each mesh. We decided to go with very natural colours like brown, green and blue because not only is our game set outdoors in nature, but those colours are also calming to look at. 

The lighting was another important factor that helped to tie objects in the whole scene together. By setting the ambient light to a light pink colour, this got rid of muddy shadows and gave the screen a slight cool tint. A directional light in each scene helped provide some soft shadows for a bit of extra detail.

The water, sadly, was one of the exeptions to the low poly aesthetic because although possible to create required the geometry shader, which is not always supported, for example on Macs, the water shader will be discussed in detail later. 

The rest of the main assets (skybox, trees, grass, shells, font) were from the asset store (see references) and were chosen primarily because of their simple, low-poly style and  colours.

We also made our own panels for the UI since we wanted the buttons to have a round shape which feels more natural. We chose to stick with a brown theme for the UI since is is a neutral colour that is found alot in nature.

The sound effects/music were mostly sourced from the internet (see references) post-processing adjustments made in Logic Pro. It was often the case where sound clips had to be spliced, faded out or combined to produce the final result. Reverb, spread and equalisation was also sometimes added. A few sound effects (fish collection sound, level completion sound) were made from scratch. We tried to keep the sound effects sounding natural, avoiding synth, electronic sounds. 

**maybe talk about the particle effects????????**

### How the graphics pipeline and camera motion was handled

## Camera motion
The camera was positioned above looking down on the the main focus of the scene, eg the player or the hook.
The camera movement was then smoothed when the target moved or switched from one object to another, this gives the player more intution about how things are placed in the world. An example of this use is in the Tutorial scenes where the camera looks at a fish and then pans back to the player, allowing them to know which direction the fish is in.
This was create using an automatic camera control method. The method was to have an target Transform, eg the Player, and the initial offset from that transform and the camera was used as the offset to then aim for. Then the camera position is Lerped towards target position (transforms position + offset) creating a smooth movement.

Our reasoning behind using an automatic control, was to guide the player on what they should be currently looking at, creating more intutive expirience.

## Graphics pipeline


### How the shaders work
#### Water Shader
This shader does a variety of effects to achieve the look of water.
##### Diffuse Colouring
The colouring of the water is broken up into shallow and deep, these colours are used to change the colour of the water depending on the depth provided by the height map.

##### Waves Displacement
With the use of a third party noise function "Bcc8NoiseClassic" provided by Keijiro, a displacement to the water is added in the vertex shader. This was parameterised by its intensity, frequency and movement direction.

##### Foam Waves
This effect creates a wave of foam that rocks up onto the shore. This was create by taking slices of the height map and then moving the slices up over time. Then a texture was overlayed ontop to create a bit of visual interest, lastly the strength of this effect was increase as the water got shallower.

##### Height Map
The height map was an integral part of making this shader work, although it was implement as a Script. At the start of the scene the HeightMapGenerator Script shoots a grid of raycasts down on the terrain to deduce its height, this is then mapped into an image for the shader to use. 

#### Why a Shader?
The main reason for this to be done on the shader was for effiecency and quality. If dynamic water was to be implemented in a Script it would require us to create/alter a new texture every frame, that would stretch accross all the water, this would require a massive texture to no look grainy. Instead with the use of a shader, this can be done in parallel, and done in screen space, only requiring the pixels that will be visible in the camera frustrum to be computed, giving higher performance and better quality.  

### Wiggle Shader
#### Displacement
The fish wiggle shader displaces the vertices of the fish to make it look like it is swimming. This is done by using `_Time` in a sin function. It was parametrised to take a speed, intensity and frequency value for the movement.

### Why a Shader?
The reason we opted to have this be done on the GPU instead of CPU was for effiecency. Since there may be many objects all with this shader, all displacing each of their vertices, it makes practical sense to have all these done in parrallel, as each vertex displacement is independent of one another.

### Its purpose
The use of this shader in this scene does 2 important things. 1 it brings the fish model to life, and helps convey the message that these are fish. 2 It can be reused on many different models without the use rigging each model individually, saving time.

## Code Snippets 

You can include a code snippet here, but make sure to explain it! 
Do not just copy all your code, only explain the important parts.

```c#
public class firstPersonController : MonoBehaviour
{
    //This function run once when Unity is in Play
     void Start ()
    {
      standMotion();
    }
}
```
