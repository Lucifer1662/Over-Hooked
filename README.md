## Explanation of the game
This game is a 3rd-person top-down fishing game with a few different levels. The aim of the game is to catch a certain amount of fish within the time limit.

### How to use it (especially the user interface aspects)
This game should be played with a keyboard and mouse. Standard WASD player movement and move mouse to look around. Left click, hold, and release to cast the fishing rod.

### How objects and entities were modelled
Objects and entites were modelled by using assets from the asset store and also by making our own in blender. Then the appropriate materials and sizing were set in Unity. 

### How the graphics pipeline and camera motion was handled

### How the shaders work
The fish wiggle shader displaces the vertices of the fish sideways by using Time in a sin function. It was parametrised to take a speed, intensity and frequency value for the movement.

## Querying and evaluation
Description of the querying and observational methods used, including: description of the participants (how many, demographics), description of the methodology (which techniques did you use, what did you have participants do, how did you record the data), and feedback gathered.

Document the changes made to your game based on the information collected during the evaluation.

## Code Snippets 

You can include a code snippet here, but make sure to explain it! 
Do not just copy all your code, only explain the important parts.

```c#
public class firstPersonController : MonoBehaviour
{
    //This function run once when Unity is in Play
     void Start ()
    {
      standMotion();
    }
}
```
